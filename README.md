# ðŸš€ Dynamic Memory Allocation in C

This basic code snippet demonstrates how to allocate and manage memory dynamically in C using pointers.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts:
1. **malloc()** - Allocates memory but contains garbage values.
2. **calloc()** - Allocates memory and initializes it to zero.
3. **realloc()** - Resizes already allocated memory.
4. **free()** - Frees up memory to prevent leaks.



## ðŸ”— How It Works:
1. User enters the number of elements.
2. `calloc()` allocates memory for those elements.
3. User inputs values, which are stored in the allocated memory.
4. The program prints the stored values.
5. `free()` is used to release the allocated memory.
